# About Me

I'm Mohammed Amour Al-Marshudi, a software engineer from Oman who believes technology should solve real problems, not just exist for its own sake.

## My Journey

I graduated from the University of Technology and Applied Sciences in January 2025 with a degree in Software Engineering. But my story with technology started long before that. I've always been the person who asks "how does this work?" and then spends hours figuring it out.

My first real web project, WikiGulf back in 2020, taught me that building something people actually use is far more rewarding than any grade. That mindset has shaped everything since.

## What Drives Me

I'm drawn to the intersection of automation and impact. At Vodafone Oman, I started as an IT & Data Automation intern where I discovered the satisfaction of turning hours of manual work into something that runs in seconds. There's something deeply fulfilling about building systems that free people from repetitive tasks so they can focus on what actually matters.

Now as an Application Engineer, I architect backend services that power enterprise applications. The problems are bigger, the stakes are higher, and I love every challenge that comes with it.

## Beyond the Day Job

I'm an entrepreneur at heart. I've co-founded ventures like WebKanZ (a travel experience platform), Kawkaban Farm (a farm-stay booking system with 50+ bookings), and DoduHash (a billing automation SaaS). These projects taught me that shipping something imperfect is infinitely better than planning something perfect that never sees the light of day.

I've also dabbled in game development, video editing, and content creation, because creativity shouldn't be confined to one medium.

## How I Work

I believe in:
- **Building for impact**, not for complexity
- **Learning by doing**, not just reading
- **Shipping early**, iterating often
- **Collaborating openly**, because the best solutions come from diverse perspectives

## The Technologies I've Worked With

Over the years, I've built with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, and more. I've used frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, React, Remix, and Node.js. I've worked with databases from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, deployed with Docker and Nginx, and automated workflows using Jira APIs, data pipelines, and CI/CD systems.

But honestly? The specific tools matter less than the problems they solve. Technology is just a means to an end, and that end should always be something that makes life better for someone.

## What I'm Looking For

I want to work on meaningful problems with people who care about quality. I want to keep learning, keep building, and keep pushing myself beyond what I thought was possible yesterday.

If that resonates with you, let's talk.
