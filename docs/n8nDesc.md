Here are a few high level, portfolio safe options you can use. They describe your n8n experience without exposing internal flow details.

### Option 1 (short and strong)

I build and operate production n8n automations for telecom operations, turning manual support tasks into reliable, audited workflows. I design webhook based orchestration that integrates internal APIs and external services, enforces validation and access controls, and produces consistent outcomes with clear operational visibility through logging and notifications.

### Option 2 (balanced, more detail but still safe)

I use n8n as an orchestration layer to automate internal TechOps processes end to end. My work includes designing secure webhook entry points, coordinating multi step API interactions, normalizing and validating data before execution, and adding operational safeguards such as correlation IDs, audit friendly outputs, and failure notifications. These automations improve turnaround time for support requests and reduce manual effort while maintaining reliability and control.

### Option 3 (more “reliability and ops” focused)

I design internal n8n workflows focused on reliability, traceability, and automation at scale. This includes integrating multiple backend systems, standardizing request handling, implementing guardrails to prevent incorrect actions, and improving operational readiness with structured logging, alerts, and clear success or error responses.

### Option 4 (one liner for CV cards)

n8n: Built production grade internal automations for TechOps, integrating APIs and notifications with validation, guardrails, and audit ready outcomes.

If you tell me where you want to place it (Experience bullet under Vodafone, Skills section, or Projects), I will format the best option to match that section.
